Problem Description :
 
You must write a function called Create (Initial state, Level number) to generate all the states of 8-puzzle game starting from the given initial state up to a particular level. The initial state and level number are the input to the Create function. Use the suitable data structure to represent the state of the 8-puzzle game and use the actions (Up, Down, Left, and Right ) to generate the new states. After creating each state of the problem calculate the heuristic value of that state. The heuristic function h(S) = number of tiles misplaced with respect to the goal state (you can define your own goal state or use the goal state which was discussed in the AI class). Print all the states which are generated by the Create function with their heuristic values.
